# GameGen-O
This repository is the official implementation of [GameGen-O](https://gamegen-o.github.io/).
It is the first diffusion transformer model tailored for the generation of open-world video games. This model facilitates high-quality, open-domain generation by simulating a wide array of game engine features, such as innovative characters, dynamic environments, complex actions, and diverse events.
